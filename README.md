# Sorting-Visualizer
Simple Sorting Visualizer created with Python and PyGame

This project is based on this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg&t).
I wanted to make something like it. For the future I want to add more sort algorithms, sound and color options.

## Control
If algorithm is finished you can press **SPACE** for another run.
